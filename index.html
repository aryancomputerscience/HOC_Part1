        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."</p>
        <p><strong>Other Information:</strong> Charles Babbage's contributions laid the foundation for modern computing. The Analytical Engine, though never fully built during his lifetime, influenced subsequent generations of computer scientists.</p>
