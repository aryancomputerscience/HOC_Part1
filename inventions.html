  <li>Difference Engine (1822): Babbage created the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator that used the finite differences method to calculate polynomial functions. The project's goal was to get rid of mistakes in mathematical tables, which were prone to mistakes made by hand when performing computations.
  </li>
   <p />
  <li>Analytical Engine (1837): The Analytical Engine, a general-purpose mechanical computer, was Babbage's most ambitious creation. It included parts like memory, conditional branching and loops for control flow, and an arithmetic logic unit. Despite not being finished during Babbage's lifetime, the Analytical Engine established the basic principles of contemporary computers.
  </li>
          <p />
  <li>Cowcatcher (railroad invention): Babbage made contributions to the transportation industry as well. He created the cowcatcher, an apparatus that locomotives use to remove obstructions from the tracks. The idea had an impact on later advancements in railway safety even if it was not generally adopted.</li>
